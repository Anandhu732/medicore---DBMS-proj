## 🔧 FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Backend Patient Routes (FIXED)

**Issue:** Doctors were excluded from adding/editing patients
**Fix:** Updated `patientRoutes.js`:

- Added `'doctor'` to `authorize()` for POST /api/patients
- Added `'doctor'` to `authorize()` for PUT /api/patients/:id

### 2. Frontend Permissions (Already Correct)

- Doctors already had `EDIT_PATIENTS` permission in frontend
- No changes needed
